              Background and Objectives
              Blood banks use a haemoglobin (Hb) threshold before blood donation to minimize donors' risk of anaemia. Hb prediction models may guide decisions on which donors to invite, and should ideally also be generally applicable, thus in different countries and settings. In this paper, we compare the outcome of various prediction models in different settings and highlight differences and similarities.
            
            
              Materials and Methods
              Donation data of repeat donors from the past 5â€‰years of Australia, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands and South Africa were used to fit five identical prediction models: logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, linear mixed model and dynamic linear mixed model. Only donors with five or more donation attempts were included to ensure having informative data from all donors. Analyses were performed for men and women separately and outcomes compared.
            
            
              Results
              Within countries and overall, different models perform similarly well. However, there are substantial differences in model performance between countries, and there is a positive association between the deferral rate in a country and the ability to predict donor deferral. Nonetheless, the importance of predictor variables across countries is similar and is highest for the previous Hb level.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The limited impact of model architecture and country indicates that all models show similar relationships between the predictor variables and donor deferral. Donor deferral is found to be better predictable in countries with high deferral rates. Therefore, such countries may benefit more from deferral prediction models than those with low deferral rates.},
